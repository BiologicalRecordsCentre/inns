`Giant Woodwasp` = 'Thank you so much for your e-mail.  We receive lots of reports of species that look like Asian hornets and I am pleased to say that the photograph you have sent is not of an Asian Hornet. Your photograph shows a Wood Wasp. It is a wasp mimic and is also a Hymenopteran like wasps but the larvae feed in the trunks of trees unlike wasps. It is completely harmless and the \'stinger\' is actually just an egg laying body part (ovipositor) elongated to inject eggs into host trees. The ovipositor is modified in other hymenoptera (e.g. bees and wasps) to sting. More information can be found at the following sites:<br>

`European Hornet` = 'Thank you so much for your e-mail. We receive lots of reports of native species that look like Asian hornets and I am pleased to say that the photograph you have sent is a native species - the European Hornet, Vespa crabro.

European Hornet activity tends to be most noticed in the spring, when queens start becoming active after overwintering and start searching for suitable nesting sites, and then again in late summer when colonies start to disperse searching for food etc - at this time of year they are often seen during the night as well as the day as they are attracted to light in moderate numbers.

More information on this fantastic native insect is available here:

`Birch Sawfly` = 'Thank you so much for your record.  We receive lots of reports of native species that look like Asian hornets and I am pleased to say that the photograph you have sent is not of an Asian Hornet. Your photograph looks to show a type of sawfly called the Birch Sawfly (Cimbex femoratus). Like hornets it is also a Hymenopteran but the larvae feed on birch leaves unlike wasps. It is completely harmless and a fantastic record, because although this species is fairly widespread and common throughout the UK, the adults are not seen that regularly. The larvae can often be easily found on birch trees and are equally impressive. More information can be found at the following sites for example:

`Ichneumonid` = 'Thank you so much for your report.  We receive lots of reports of native species that look like Asian hornets and I am pleased to say that the photograph you have sent is not of an Asian Hornet. Your photograph shows a species of ichneumonid, a type of parasitoid wasp. This is one of the largest groups of insects and there are many very similar species, many of which require dissection to ascertain which species they are and are rarely identifiable to species level from photographs. Although they appear quite different to the insects we commonly refer to as ‘wasps’ (e.g. Common Wasp, Vespula vulgaris), many mimic the yellow and black coloration for defense, and they are also Hymenopterans. More information can be found at the following sites:

`Missing Locality` = 'Thank you so much for your report.  Please could you respond with details of  the location of your sighting so the record can be added to the database, a postcode or village / town name would be fine. 

Please also take a look at the following identification sheets and do get back to us if you are still concerned that it may have been an Asian hornet: Identification sheet and https://secure.fera.defra.gov.uk/beebase/downloadDocument.cfm?id=698. If you wish for assistance you can contact your local beekeeping association by using the British Beekeepers Association Asian hornet action team map. https://www.bbka.org.uk/asian-hornet-action-team-map  Zoom into your locality to find a coordinators email address and telephone number and they will arrange contact with a local beekeeper to help with identifying and reporting.

Reports such as yours are essential in maintaining early detection if this species does arrive in the UK. We receive many reports throughout the year, most of which are of the native European Hornet, Vespa crabro, which is slightly larger than the Asian Hornet, but with a lot more yellow on the abdomen. Other reports include other wasp species, especially the larger queens, bees and a range of wasp and bee mimic hoverflies. The Bees, Wasps & Ants Recording Society (BWARS) have an excellent website on which more information on native species can be found. For example, information on the European Hornet can be found at: http://www.bwars.com/sites/www.bwars.com/files/info_sheets/Vespa-crabro-info-sheet.pdf
