woodwasp <- 'Thank you so much for your e-mail.  We receive lots of reports of species that look like Asian hornets and I am pleased to say that the photograph you have sent is not of an Asian Hornet. Your photograph shows a Wood Wasp. It is a wasp mimic and is also a Hymenopteran like wasps but the larvae feed in the trunks of trees unlike wasps. It is completely harmless and the \'stinger\' is actually just an egg laying body part (ovipositor) elongated to inject eggs into host trees. The ovipositor is modified in other hymenoptera (e.g. bees and wasps) to sting. More information can be found at the following sites:<br>

Could you enter the record, with photo, at https://www.brc.ac.uk/irecord/enter-casual-record? This will be very useful as a record of this species. Only the fields marked with a red asterisk * are required. You can enter the "spatial reference" simply by clicking on the map.

If you have a smart phone or tablet / iPad, you can also use the Asian Hornet Watch app, which is available free for Android and Apple devices:

Thank you again for your report - it is a magnificent creature and a great find, and such reports are also extremely useful for non-native species surveillance.  Please do report any future sightings of concern by using the on-line form or app.

eurohornet <- 'Thank you so much for your e-mail. We receive lots of reports of native species that look like Asian hornets and I am pleased to say that the photograph you have sent is a native species - the European Hornet, Vespa crabro.

European Hornet activity tends to be most noticed in the spring, when queens start becoming active after overwintering and start searching for suitable nesting sites, and then again in late summer when colonies start to disperse searching for food etc - at this time of year they are often seen during the night as well as the day as they are attracted to light in moderate numbers.

More information on this fantastic native insect is available here:
